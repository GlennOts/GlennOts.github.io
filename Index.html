      <h2>Personal stuff</h2>
        <h3> A new page in my life </h3>
            <p>Hello everyone! I am 25 years old and recently graduated from the Free University
              Brussels with a masters degree in clinical psychology. It was
            when I started my internship I felt it wasn't the right direction for me anymore.<br/>

            So that was the moment I knew I had to make a switch before I even started
            my career. In my studies I have had a lot of statistics so I am used to analysing
            and even coding.<br/>

            This is why switchfully was a <strong> great </strong> opportunity for me to change
            starting career. <br/>
            So soon I will become a <em>functional analyst!</em></p><br>

            until I went to University. To have a better balance between school and sport, I started
            to do fitness while maintaining to run a few times a week. When its winter I also like
            to ride my mountainbike. </p>
