                    <strong><li> R </li></strong>
                      <p>
                        Throughout my studies, I have used the software program R.<br>
                        <br>
                        R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.
                        It provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
                        </p>
                    <strong><li> SPSS </li></strong>
                      <p> A second statistical software program I used during my studies is SPSS.<br>
                        <br>
                        The IBM SPSS® software platform offers advanced statistical analysis, a vast library of machine learning algorithms,
                        text analysis, open source extensibility, integration with big data and seamless deployment into applications.</p>
                    <u><h3>New skills under development</h3></u>
                    <strong><li> HTML </li></strong>
                      <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
                        It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
                        The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.</p>
                    <strong><li> CSS </li></strong>
                      <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
                        <br>
                        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                    <strong><li> SQL </li></strong>
                      <p>Structured Query Language, commonly known as SQL, is a standard programming language for relational databases.
                        Despite being older than many other types of code, it is the most widely implemented database language.<br>
                        SQL can be used to share and manage data, particularly data that is found in relational database management systems, which include data organized into tables.
                        Multiple files, each containing tables of data, also may be related together by a common field.
