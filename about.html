            <h1>Hi everyone, thanks for visiting my website!</h1>

            <em><h3> A new page in my life </h3></em>
              <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my website. Let me introduce myself real quick.
                I am currently 25 years old, and I have lived all my life in a little town called Leerbeek.
                It's a very quiet and rural commune with about 1100 inhabitants which is part of the
                'Pearl of the Pajottenland'. If you like walking through nature,
                I can definitely recommend this region!<br/>
                <br>
                I have always been very sportive, and I still am. From when I was a kid I played football until I went to University.
                To have a better balance between school and sport, I started with fitness while maintaining to run a few times a week.
                When its winter I also like to ride my mountain bike.<br/>
                <br>
                Recently I graduated from the Free University of Brussels with a master's degree in clinical psychology.
                During my studies, I did an eight-month internship at the University Psychiatric Centre KU Leuven,
                where I worked in the alcohol and drug addiction department. My work consisted of two parts. On the one hand,
                I did individual and group interviews, on the other hand, I did the diagnostics.
                I learned a lot about life and how to deal with difficult periods thanks to this internship.
                But it was when my internship almost came to an end, I felt it wasn't the right direction for me anymore.<br/>
                <br>
                So that was the moment I knew I had to make a switch before I even started
                my career. This is why switchfully was a <strong> great </strong> opportunity for me to change
                starting career. So soon I will become a <em><strong> functional analyst!</strong></em></p>
                You are probably wondering what added value someone with a degree in psychology has for this job.
                My education has given me strong analytical and communicative qualities,
                and these are exactly the two building blocks for this job!<br/>
