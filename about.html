            <h1>Hi everyone, thanks for visiting my website!</h1>

            <em><h3> A new page in my life </h3></em>
              <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my website. Let me introduce myself really quickly.
                I am currently 25 years old and and have lived in leerbeek all my life.
                It's a small quiet village with about just 1000 inhabitants and
                is also called the 'pearl of the Pajottenland' because of its soft hilly, fertile agricultural region.
                If you like walking through nature, I can definitely recommend this region!<br/>
                <br>
                I have always been very sportive, and I still am. From when I was a kid until I went to the University,
                I had one passion and that was playing football.
                To have a better balance between school and sport, I started with the combination of fitness and running a few times a week.
                As soon as the gentle chill in the air turns into biting cold you know winter has arrived and is it wonderful to take a ride on a mountain bike.<br/>
                <br>
                Recently I graduated from the Free University of Brussels with a master's degree in clinical psychology.
                During my studies, I did an eight-month internship at the University Psychiatric Centre KU Leuven,
                where I worked in the alcohol and drug addiction department. My work consisted of two tasks.
                First I did serveral individual and group interviews, secondly it was important to make the correct diagnoses.
                During this internship I learned a lot about life and how to deal with it in difficult times.
                Nevertheless, realization played across my mind that this specialty was not mine after all.
                At this moment I knew for sure a switch was badly needed before starting my work career.
                <br/>
                <br>
                So that was the moment I knew I had to make a switch before I even started
                my career. This is why switchfully was a <strong> great </strong> opportunity to change my starting career.
                So soon I will become a <em><strong> functional analyst!</strong></em></p>
                You were probably wondering what added value someone with a degree in psychology can offer to this job.
                However, my training gave me strong analytical and communication skills which forms the perfect basis to start this job.<br/>
